## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test thoroughly** on multiple platforms if possible
4. **Update documentation** if you've added functionality
5. **Ensure your code** follows the existing style
6. **Submit your pull request**

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features when appropriate
- Follow existing naming conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions

  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### CSS
- Use BEM methodology for class naming
- Follow the existing color scheme and variables
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Use modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
